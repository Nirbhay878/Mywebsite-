  <section>
    <p>I’m Nirbhay Singla, currently a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Sydney. I’m working to accelerate innovative tech, with a strong focus on hands-on projects and real-world problem-solving. Our team is lean, ambitious, and backed by mentors who share our drive to build fast and learn faster.</p>

    <p>I got my start in tech as a teenager, earning an Apple Scholarship early on, and since then, I’ve been privileged to work alongside and learn from talented founders, engineers, and creators. Rather than following a traditional path, I’ve continuously challenged myself to create, iterate, and bring impactful projects to life.</p>

    <p>This website is still a work in progress. I used to write frequently, but now my focus is on building, learning, and sharing insights when I can. Until I publish more, my Twitter is where I share my latest thoughts and updates.</p>

    <h2>Beliefs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>"Strive for ambition over comfort."</em> — I believe in pushing boundaries to find my true limits, and I’d rather make ambitious mistakes than settle for mediocrity.</li>
      <li>Speed is a core value. It’s not just about how fast you move, but the cycle of learning and improving that speed creates.</li>
      <li>Growth for young people is about rate of progress; think of life less as a chess game and more as a sprint. Taking no action is missing out on shots that might lead to big wins.</li>
      <li>Software is transforming rapidly. In the "post-GPT" landscape, the advantage is in building unique tech, not just distribution. The technical arbitrage era is fading fast.</li>
      <li>People matter. I value kindness, transparency, and directness — life is short, and lasting relationships can often come from a simple act of openness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
    <p>In a world where we’re nearing a future of abundance, I’m drawn to the fundamental question: "Why is there something rather than nothing?" For me, understanding cognition and intelligence is key. Accelerating our grasp on these domains might one day lead us to answers about the universe’s biggest mysteries. All my work is tied to this larger pursuit of knowledge.</p>
    <p>Until I have the means to mine asteroids, I’m thrilled to work with people who challenge me, expand my perspectives, and keep the pace high. Building and learning alongside ambitious minds is where I thrive most.</p>
