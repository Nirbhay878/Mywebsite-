  <section>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nirbhay. I’m a first-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Sydney, driven by curiosity and a deep love for building and understanding things. My journey in tech started with coding and freelance projects during high school, and over the years, I've expanded my focus to include digital logic, circuit design, and 3D modeling. I've been fortunate to receive awards like the Apple Scholarship, work with creative teams, and fund my own projects through freelance work.</p>

    <p>Outside of academics, I’m always looking to push my boundaries. From exploring Sydney to taking on new challenges in sports, I enjoy experiences that keep me growing and engaged. Right now, my projects involve image processing and state machines, and I’m always excited to apply what I learn in new ways.</p>

    <p>This website is still a work in progress. In the future, I plan to share more about my projects, my thoughts on technology and engineering, and the occasional essay on topics I’m passionate about. Until then, feel free to reach out or check my Twitter for updates.</p>

    <h2>Beliefs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning is lifelong. I believe in staying curious, open, and ready to tackle new challenges.</li>
      <li>Progress matters. Early on, I’ve seen the impact of setting small, consistent goals that build over time.</li>
      <li>Hands-on learning is essential. Building something yourself teaches more than any lecture.</li>
      <li>People and experiences shape you. I value directness, kindness, and the chance to grow through meaningful connections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Drives Me?</h2>
    <p>I’m passionate about understanding complex systems, and I’m always in pursuit of the next challenge. Engineering and technology give me the chance to work on practical solutions, apply creativity, and contribute something meaningful. Someday, I hope to work on impactful projects in aerospace and robotics, fields that inspire and push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
    <p>For now, I’m building a strong foundation in engineering and looking forward to connecting with others who share the same drive. If that sounds like you, let’s connect!</p>
